- CSS Grid has 18 new properties plus other concepts, you don't need all of them to know.
- efficiency with the CSS Grid layout is key, so just dive in, don't try to be a master at it.
- I like to view the CSS Grid layout and Flexbox as siblings. The CSS grid being an older sibling.
- Handling Layouts in CSS have been difficult and crappy. Flexbox brought a bit of fresh air — but the CSS Grid is even better.
